# Vertex Swing
Vertex Swing is a fun and exciting 2D vertical game made in GameMaker Studio 2. This game began as a high school project back in 2019, and has evolved into a challenging and enjoyable pastime.

In the game, your character is a red circle that can grapple onto blue blocks strategically placed throughout the level. The goal is to reach the top by swinging from block to block without falling to the bottom. If your character does fall, don't worry! The game resets at the start of the current level, giving you as many chances as you need to conquer each challenge.

### Installation
To install the game, head over to the Releases section of the repository and download the installer from the first release v0.0.0. Simply follow the installer instructions and you'll be swinging your way up the levels in no time!

### Usage
Once installed, launch the game and start your adventure! As you progress through the levels, they become increasingly challenging, so brace yourself for a thrilling ride!

The game was made possible thanks to GameMaker Studio 2, a platform that sparked my interest in programming at a young age. I hope you enjoy playing Vertex Swing as much as I enjoyed creating it.

At this moment, there are no concrete plans for further development of Vertex Swing. However, the beauty of open-source projects is that they can continually evolve with community input.
